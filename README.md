## description

The Advanced Encryption Tool is a secure and user-friendly desktop application developed using Python, designed to encrypt and decrypt files using industry-standard AES-256 encryption via the cryptography library.

## Objective:

To build a robust encryption application that protects sensitive data by allowing users to:

Encrypt files so unauthorized users can't access their contents.

Decrypt previously encrypted files securely using a secret key.

## Technologies Used:

Python 3: Core programming language

Fernet (Cryptography Library): Ensures AES-256 encryption with integrity verification

Tkinter: Python's built-in library for creating the graphical user interface

## Features:

AES-256 Level Security using Fernet

Simple GUI with buttons to:

Select and encrypt files

Decrypt .enc files back to their original content

Easy-to-use file dialog for selecting input/output files

Automatically handles key-based encryption and decryption

## How It Works:

The user selects a file using the Encrypt File button.

The file is encrypted and saved as <filename>.enc.

The Decrypt File button reverses the process, recovering the original content using the same secret key.

## Outcome:

Fully functional, cross-platform encryption tool

Clean and modern GUI interface

Meets internship requirements by demonstrating secure file handling and GUI application development
